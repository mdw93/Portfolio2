# Portfolio2
Portfolio website two (bootstrap based)

Website two for showcasing my growing portfolio, it is primarily bootstrap based. It gives you a bit of information on myself and showcases three of my projects (with links to them).

I need to further refine the layout, specifically the images (I need to further research the best practices/way to creating images for this type of situation). 

Overall big improvement compared to my first site, but still needs further refinement.
